# GildedRoseAPP

## teck used

I have choose to use the react framework to start the project with "CLI" create-react-app to create a workspace quickly.

I know that this method results in a load of several modules that I am not going to use but seeing this small project, I have thought that it is not going to be a problem.

## Compile and run this code

  **Open your terminal**

1. With CLI clone repo
2. cd gilded-rose-app 
3. $ npm i --save 
4. $ yarn start
